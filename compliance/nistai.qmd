# NIST AI 600-1: Generative AI Risk Management Profile

The **NIST AI 600-1** document, titled *Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework: Generative Artificial Intelligence Profile*, is a companion to NIST's broader AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0). It specifically focuses on **Generative AI (GAI)** and how organizations can manage the **risks unique to or exacerbated by GAI systems**.

## Purpose of the Profile

- Supports **Executive Order 14110** on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI.
- Helps orgs manage GAI risks using **Govern, Map, Measure, Manage** functions.
- Encourages **cross-sectoral** adoption of safe, responsible AI practices.

## Main Sections

### 1. Introduction
Explains the profile’s role as an implementation guide for using the AI RMF with Generative AI.

### 2. Risks Unique to or Exacerbated by GAI
Outlines 12 key risk areas, such as:

- Confabulation (hallucination)
- Data privacy
- CBRN threats
- Harmful bias & homogenization
- Environmental impact
- IP violations
- Deepfakes & abuse content
- Human over-reliance or aversion
- Info integrity and security issues

> Each risk is mapped to **Trustworthy AI Characteristics** like safety, privacy, accountability, and fairness.

### 3. Suggested Actions
Detailed tables aligned with AI RMF categories and subcategories, providing **actionable steps** for managing GAI risk at every stage of the AI lifecycle.

## ✅ Categories of GAI Risk (Section 2 Summary)

| Category | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| CBRN Information | Access to dangerous knowledge or tools |
| Confabulation | Generating believable but false content |
| Dangerous Content | Self-harm, violence, radicalization |
| Data Privacy | Leaks, inferences, training on PII |
| Environmental | High compute/energy use |
| Bias & Homogenization | Amplifying stereotypes or flattening diversity |
| Human-AI Config | Misuse due to over-trust or anthropomorphizing AI |
| Info Integrity | Disinformation, deepfakes |
| Info Security | GAI used for hacking or vulnerable to attacks |
| IP Risk | Copyright, plagiarism, trade secrets |
| Obscene/Abusive | Nonconsensual AI-generated content |
| Supply Chain | Lack of transparency in upstream components |

---

## Suggested Next Steps for Teams

- Align internal policies with **Govern** section guidance.
- Implement **risk-based model assessments**.
- Develop strong **incident response plans** and content provenance strategies.
- Perform **human-in-the-loop evaluations** to detect hallucinations, bias, or misuse.
