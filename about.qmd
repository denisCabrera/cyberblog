# About Me

Hey — I'm glad you're here.

I'm a cybersecurity practitioner who spends a lot of time exploring how technology works under the hood — especially when it comes to **cloud infrastructure**, **AI systems**, and the ever-growing landscape of **digital threats**.

This blog is my personal knowledge base, journal, and experiment log. I write about:

- Cybersecurity fundamentals & emerging threats  
- Securing cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
- AI security — prompt injection, model exploits, data leakage  
- Tools, checklists, real-world scenarios, and walkthroughs

My goal is simple: **make complex security topics easier to understand**, and share what I learn as I go.

Whether you're just getting started in tech or you've been in the trenches for years — I hope you find something here that helps you think deeper, work smarter, or stay a little more secure.

Let’s build and break things — responsibly.
